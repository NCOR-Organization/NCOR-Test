<h1>NCOR Document Acts Working Group</h1>

<h2>D-Acts</h2>
<p>D-Acts was developed and promoted by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XYKYeXwAAAAJ" class="custom-color">Mathias Brochhausen</a>, extends from the Basic Formal Ontology, and aims to represent document acts, social acts, and associated legal entities.</p>

<h2>NCOR D-Acts WG</h2>
<p>The aim of the NCOR Document Acts Working Group (DAWG) is to cultivate understanding of, provide contributions to, and promote development of the D-Acts ontology. The group is comprised of academics, students, and professionals with a common interest in D-Acts ontology engineering, application, validation, and use cases.</p>
<p>The DAWG is chaired by <a href="https://blueiguanaconservation.org/informed-consent-ontology-ontobee" class="custom-color">Jonathan Vajda</a>. Meetings regularly involve discussion of D-Acts projects, such as design pattern refinement and alignment with nearby open-source ontologies. Please see the minutes from past meetings below for a better understanding of topics covered.</p>
<p>If you would like to attend D-Acts meetings either in-person or remotely, contact Jonathan at: jvajda[@]buffalo.edu.</p>
