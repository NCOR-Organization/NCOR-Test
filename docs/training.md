Basic Formal Ontology ISO/IEC 21838:2 Specialist 

Participants will gain facility with applying BFO classes and relations to a range of practical modeling problems while maintaining conformance to the top-level ontology 21838:2 specification. A standard training package consists of four days, 4 hours per day, for a total of 16 hours. An expedited training package consists of two days, 8 hours per day, for a total of 16 hours. Topics covered include:

Construction and application of BFO-conformant design patterns
Translating natural language into BFO-conformant terminology
Use of BFO and extensions - such as the Common Core Ontologies suite - to represent intelligence gathering, defense, and cyber security
Motivation for and critical analysis of the BFO hierarchy
Comparison of BFO modeling choice-points to those found in other top-level ontology architectures
 

Tentative Schedule (4 Day)

Day 1

Top-Level Principles of BFO
The BFO Hierarchy
Formal Implementations of BFO
Day 2

From Natural Language to BFO Implementations
BFO-Conformant Design Patterns
Participant Evaluation
Day 3

Extending BFO using Common Core Ontologies
BFO/CCO-Conformant Design Patterns
From Natural Language to BFO/CCO
Day 4

Upper-Level Rivals to BFO: DOLCE, YAMATO
Critical Comparison of Upper-Level Ontologies
Participant Evaluation
 

Expedited schedule merges Day 1 and 2, and Day 3 and 4, holding an evaluation each day. Participants will be evaluated by way of two exams, consisting of multiple choice and essay questions designed to check competency with the material covered. Successful completion of this credential requires an average of 70 across both exams.

 

Applied Ontology Engineering Specialist 

Aimed at cultivating expertise with ontology engineering technologies, and promoting facility with constructing, maintaining, and curating ontologies in a modern software development workflow.
