NCOR draws on the expertise of ontologists associated with the University at Buffalo and of their collaborators in scientific, commercial, and government institutions throughout the world.</p> <p>NCOR serves as a vehicle to coordinate, enhance, publicize, and seek funding for ontological research activities. It provides coordination, infrastructure, and independent review to organizations employing ontologies in fields such as defense and intelligence, management, healthcare, and biomedical sciences.</p> <p>It provides researchers working in ontology-related areas with specialized support in seeking external funding and in assembling collaborative, interdisciplinary teams both nationally and internationally. It provides consultant services for ontology projects, especially in the defense and security fields and in health care and biomedical informatics. NCOR also engages in training and outreach endeavors that are designed to broaden the range of institutions and individuals accepting the goals of high-quality ontology in both theory and practice.</p> Contemporary Ontology <p>Contemporary ontology is a partnership of multiple disciplines. On the one hand, ontological research involves philosophers who are concerned to describe broad categories of entities and their most basic relationships. On the other hand, ontologists are working in diverse fields of computer and information science to provide more narrowly focused classification systems in areas such as bioinformatics, engineering, or defense and security.</p> <p>Ontologists have identified a wide range of theories and methods to aid the consistent representation of data and information. The idea, in all these cases, is that when bodies of data are annotated using well-structured ontologies, these data can be more easily retrieved, integrated, and compared, and they can more easily be exploited for purposes of computer-based reasoning.</p> <p>In biology and biomedicine ontologists have developed controlled vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology that are being used to describe the results of biological experiments in a consistent fashion that allows comparison of data pertaining to multiple species, diseases, and biological systems. In government, administration, and commerce, ontologies such as the Common Core Ontologies are being used to connect data across different departments (such as large government agencies) and to make these data accessible to standard software tools.</p> <p>Ontologists study how definitions, classifications, and relationships should be formulated using the tools of logic and formal semantics in order to most effectively achieve these goals. Their research provides foundations for diverse technologies in areas such as information integration, natural language processing, data annotation, and the construction of intelligent computer systems. Ontologies can also be used by human beings to codify and make explicit common understandings that support human-to-human communication and successful collaborative research across disciplinary boundaries.</p>"},{"location":"cco-wg/","title":"Common Core Ontologies WG","text":"<p> NCOR Common Core Ontologies Working Group</p> <p></p> NCOR Common Core Ontologies Working Group Common Core Ontologies <p>The Common Core Ontologies (CCO) were developed and promoted by Ron Rudnicki and is comprised of 11 ontologies extending from Basic Formal Ontology that aim to represent and integrate taxonomies of generic classes and relations across all domains.</p> NCOR CCO WG <p>The aim of the NCOR Common Core Ontologies Working Group (CCOWG) is to cultivate an understanding of, provide contributions to, and promote development of the Common Core Ontology (CCO) suite.

The purpose of GAOS is to promote grad students' academic work in applied ontology; specifically, the goal is to increase the chance of getting accepted for presentations at the American Philosophy Association (APA) meetings. Our short-term goal is to be affiliated with American Philosophy Association and invite members. The medium-term goal is to solicit enough papers to host a special session at the upcoming APA meetings. In the long run, GAOS aims to advertise and promote applied ontology to a bigger audience and facilitate academic work in applied ontology among graduate students.</p> <p>GAOS is co-organized by Jisoo Seo, Sean Kindya, Giacomo De Colle, Federico Donato, Giorgio Ubbiali, Jonathan Vajda, and Finn Wilson.
